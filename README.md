# Mushroom-Classification
## Problem Statement: 
We have to classify whether the mushroom is edible or poisonous based on various features.
## Description: 
This notebook classfies mushroom into poisonous or edible using various features. Here we have used the dataset containing around 8000 + species. We have used Logistic Regression to build the model. Also we have used Linear Discriminant Analysis and Quadratic Discriminant Analysis to analyse the data. 
## Data
The dataset was originally contributed to the UCI Machine Learning repository nearly 30 years ago.
The features of the dataset is mentioned in the notebook
## Algorithm
We have used Logisitic Regression for this model though we can use various models like Principal Component Analysis , Gaussian Naive Bayes , Support Vector Machine , Random Forest Classifier , Decision trees , Simple neural network
